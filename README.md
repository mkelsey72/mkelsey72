# The Run Down
Hi, Iâ€™m Kels! <br>
I am currently a student majoring in computer science. This account showcases all of my projects I have created or participated in creating.
I especially enjoy developing applications for mixed reality headsets, more so augmented reality than virtual. At the university, I have worked on an undergraduate project involving mixed reality along with many other projects required by various courses.
